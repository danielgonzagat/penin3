  "gemini": "Here is an analysis of a unified AI evolution system.\n\n### 1. Improvement: Semantic Consensus Layer\n\nInstead of fixed APIs, systems communicate through a shared, dynamic vocabulary of \"semantic tokens.\" The meaning of each token (e.g., a float value representing `urgency_level`) is not fixed but is constantly updated by all participating AIs based on the success or failure of joint outcomes. This allows the communication protocol itself to evolve.\n\n### 2. Novel Emergent Behavior: Conceptual Scaffolding\n\nA simple, foundational token (e.g., `TOKEN_PRESENCE` indicating an object exists) could become a prerequisite for the emergence of more complex tokens. AIs would discover they cannot effectively negotiate the meaning of `TOKEN_THREAT` without first reaching consensus on `TOKEN_PRESENCE`. This creates a dependency graph of concepts, where abstract ideas are built upon simpler, agreed-upon ones, mirroring cognitive development without being explicitly programmed.\n\n### 3.
