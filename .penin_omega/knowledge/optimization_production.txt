            Production AI System Optimization:
            
            1. Model Compression: Quantization, pruning, and knowledge distillation for deployment efficiency.
            
            2. Inference Optimization: TensorRT, ONNX Runtime, and hardware-specific optimizations.
            
            3. Monitoring: Real-time performance metrics, drift detection, and automated retraining triggers.
            
            4. Scaling: Horizontal scaling with load balancers, auto-scaling groups, and container orchestration.
            
            5. Reliability: Circuit breakers, graceful degradation, and comprehensive error handling.
